## üöÄ Installation Steps

### 1. Backend Configuration

#### Step 1.1: Add OpenAI API Key
Edit `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
# Replace 'your-openai-api-key-here' with your actual OpenAI API key
openai.api.key=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Keep your API key secure! Never commit it to version control.

#### Step 1.2: Verify Dependencies
All required dependencies are already in your `pom.xml`:
- ‚úÖ OkHttp (for API calls)
- ‚úÖ JSON parsing libraries
- ‚úÖ Spring Web & Multipart

### 2. Frontend Configuration

#### Step 2.1: Verify Service is Imported
Check that the service is registered in `app.module.ts`. If not, add:

```typescript
import { VoiceCoachService } from './services/voice-coach.service';

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    VoiceCoachService,
    // ... other services
  ]
})
```

#### Step 2.2: Configure API URL (Optional)
If your backend runs on a different port, update the API URL in:
`EDUCATION/src/app/services/voice-coach.service.ts`

```typescript
private apiUrl = 'http://localhost:8083/api/voice';  // Change port if needed
```

---

## üé¨ Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or if using Windows:
```bash
cd backend
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

The backend will start on **http://localhost:8083**

### 2. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd EDUCATION
npm install  # If not already done
ng serve
```

The frontend will start on **http://localhost:4200**

### 3. Navigate to Voice Coach

Open your browser and go to:
- http://localhost:4200/voice-coach

(Or wherever your routing is configured for the voice-coach component)

  { 
    id: 11, 
    sentence: 'Your new sentence here', 
    difficulty: 'Easy', 
    category: 'Conversation' 
  },
  // Add more exercises...
];
```

### Change TTS Voice
Edit `backend/src/main/java/com/example/backend/services/VoiceCoachService.java`:

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Could not access microphone"
**Solution**: 
- Grant microphone permissions in your browser
- Use HTTPS or localhost (required for microphone access)
- Check browser console for specific errors

### Issue: "Whisper API error"
**Solution**:
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check if you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Ensure your API key has Whisper API access

### Issue: "Audio file too large"
**Solution**:
- Recording is limited to 25MB by default
- Adjust `spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size` in application.properties

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**:
- Backend has `@CrossOrigin(origins = "*")` enabled
- If still having issues, configure CORS properly in Spring Boot

### Issue: No audio playback
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for codec errors
- Try different browsers (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- Verify audio file MIME types
